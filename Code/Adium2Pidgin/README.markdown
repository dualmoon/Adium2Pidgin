Adium2Pidgin
============

_A collection of scripts intended to convert Adium Xtras to Pidgin resources_

This is a collection of scripts intended to develop into a full suite of tools to convert Adium Xtras such as:
- Sound schemes
- Smiley themes
- Status icon themes
- Buddy list themes
to a format understandable by Pidgin. Hopefully this could be the start of solid proof that Adium and Pidgin should work a little more closely. More than that I can only hope that the Pidgin developers understand that Linux and Windows users **really** want more customization a-la Adium.

AdiumXtraEmoticonSet.py
-----------------------

This script takes one argument, a .zip file containing a *.AdiumEmoticonSet folder. It will convert and install the theme instantly and (currently) without any warning whatsoever. Themes are installed to ~/.purple/smileys. Obviously this will not work in Windows... ;)
